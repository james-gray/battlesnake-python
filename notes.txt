assume no new food spawns on turn
each turn
    check every permutation of how other snakes could move
    have a function that decides whether the move that we make for that outcome is valuable
        think about what could be good/what could be bad
        win conditions/loss conditions

        moving closer to food is good
        dieing is bad


V1:
circle
V2:
diverge for guaranteed food
V3:
simple agression
V4:
fancy agression

if no valid moves allowing us to survive:
    go back on self
